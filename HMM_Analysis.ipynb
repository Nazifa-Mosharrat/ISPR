The comparison between Viterbi algorithm and posterior decoding highlighted the robustness of the chosen model configuration, with a high level of agreement between the two methods.\n",

Such as here the analysis focused on a single sensor's data, incorporating information from other sensors could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns. Exploring correlations between different sensor readings and integrating them into the HMM framework may enhance model performance."
